text-proxy-extension
====================

The chrome extension that pairs with [text-proxy](https://github.com/skeggse/text-proxy) to provide a realtime view into a subset of an arbitrary open page in chrome.

More documentation coming soon.

Also some help with [stackoverflow/24152866](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24152866/chrome-extension-inject-script-into-popup-with-blank-url) would be appreciated.
